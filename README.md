- [Texture Seed](https://textureseed.com/) | 🛠️ Developer 🛠️

We generated thousands of seamless textures with SD, PBR maps with a pix2pix cGAN, and upscaled with R-ESRGAN. I had to modify the models slightly for cGAN and R-ESRGAN to be properly tiling, along with a lot of fine tuning of the outputs.

The results can be found and downloaded here: [Texture Seed Website](https://textureseed.com/) | [Texture Seed Discord](https://discord.gg/7mEF9rjB4f)

- [Production RP](https://productionrp.net/) | 🛠️ Developer 🛠️

Production RP is a roleplay server more focused on serious role-play from all aspects of live utilizing the FiveM platform and GTA 5.
